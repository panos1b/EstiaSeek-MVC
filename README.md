# EstiaSeek - MVC
 Individual Project for Information Systems Implementation and Architecture
### Thema
 This  Project aims to create a job seeking service which will connect employees and employers looking for a job in the hospitality industry. This repository partly implements [panos1b/EstiaSeek](https://github.com/panos1b/ISIA) on Microsoft .NET Core MVC framework
### Inspiration
 The project gathers inspiration from the Information Systems Implementation and Architecture class and the default project given by our tutor.
### More details
This work concerns the implementation of the "EstiaSeek" website, which is an online job search and publication space, exclusively in the hospitality industry.
Through the website, users interested in work can search, based on specific criteria, for available jobs in hospitality businesses, even expressing their interest in them, if they wish.
Corporate users of the website have the possibility to post new jobs in their company, setting their requirements. For each position they post, they can see which candidates have expressed interest. Furthermore, they have the possibility to search for professionals, based on certain criteria.
If a user is not logged in, they can search for job candidates. However, for the rest of the website's processes, you need to register and log in.
### MVC implementation
Currently only the searching of job candidates has been implemented
